The view has been identified as the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry Night. \\\"Through the iron-barred window,\\\" he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, \\\"I can see an enclosed square of wheat ... above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.\\","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night","slug":{"current":"starry-night"},"artist":{"name":"Vincent Van Gogh"}}]}}}
